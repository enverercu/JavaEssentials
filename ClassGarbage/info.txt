Java uses the garbage collector to free memory which is occupied 
by those objects which is no more reference by any of the program.

An object becomes eligible for Garbage Collection when no live thread can access it.

There are many ways to make a class reachable and thus prevent it from being eligible for Garbage Collection:

1. Objects of that class are still reachable.
2. Class object representing the class is still reachable.
3. ClassLoader that loaded the class is still reachable.
4. Other classes loaded by the ClassLoader are still reachable.
