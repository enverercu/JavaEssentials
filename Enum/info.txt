Can == be used on enum?
Yes: enums have tight instance controls that allows you to use == to compare instances.

What Is an Enum and How We Can Use It?
Enum is a type of class that allows developers to specify a set of predefined constant values.

public enum Day {
    SUNDAY, MONDAY, TUESDAY, WEDNESDAY, THURSDAY, FRIDAY, SATURDAY 
}

To iterate over all constants we can use the static values() method. 
What's more, enums enable us to define members such as properties and methods like regular classes.

Another interesting advantage of Enums is that they are thread-safe and so they are popularly used as singletons.
