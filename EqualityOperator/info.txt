Can we compare String using equality operator (==) operator?

We can compare String using equality operator. But we mostly use equals() method because of following reasons.

The equality operator is used to compare "primitives values" only where as equals method() should be used to compare objects.

equals() method is used to perform "character based comparison".

equals() return true if two String represent to the "same object" or when both "strings contents" are exactly same 

but == equality operator returns true if "two string object represents to same object" 
but "return false" if "two different string object" contains "same contents".


Summary
1) use == to compare primitive e.g. boolean, int, char etc, while use equals() to compare objects in Java.
2) == return true if two reference are of same object. Result of equals() method depends on overridden implementation.
3) For comparing String use equals() instead of  == equality operator.
