the differences between an applet and an application are as follows:

 Applets can be embedded in HTML pages and downloaded over the Internet 
 whereas Applications have no special support in HTML for embedding or downloading.
 
 Application starts execution with its "main" method whereas Applet starts execution with its "init" method.
 
 Application must be run "on local machine" whereas applet needs no explicit installation on local machine.
 
 Application must be run explicitly within a java-compatible virtual machine 
 whereas applet loads and runs itself automatically in a java-enabled browser.
 
 Application can run with or without graphical user interface 
 whereas applet must run within a graphical user interface.
