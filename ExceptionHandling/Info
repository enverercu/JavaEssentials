Throwable is the super class of Exception and Error class in Java.

throws ile throw arasýndaki fark nedir.
The throw keyword is used to explicitly raise a exception within the program.
On the contrary, the throws clause is used to indicate those exceptions that are not handled by a method. 
Each method must explicitly specify which exceptions does not handle, 
so the callers of that method can guard against possible exceptions. 
Finally, multiple exceptions are separated by a comma.

All exception classes in Java extend the class ‘Throwable’. Throwable has two subclasses, Error and Exception

The Error class defines the exception or the problems that are not expected to occur under 
normal circumstances by our program, example Memory error, Hardware error, JVM error, etc

The Exception class represents the exceptions that can be handled by our program, 
and our program can be recovered from this exception using try and catch block

A Runtime exception is a sub-class of the exception class. 
The Exception of these type represents exception that occur at the run time and 
which cannot be tracked at the compile time. An excellent example of same is divide by zero exception, 
or null pointer exception, etc

IO exception is generated during input and output operations

Interrupted exceptions in Java, is generated during multiple threading.


What is throws keyword in Java?
throws keyword is used to declare that a method may throw one or some exceptions. 
The caller must catch the exceptions.

java provides an option, wherein whenever you are using a risky piece of code in the 
method definition you declare it throws an exception without implementing try catch


there are two methods to handle Exceptions.

Put the Exception causing code in try and catch block.
Declare the method to be throwing an Exception
