What Is the Difference Between Static and Dynamic Class Loading?
Static class loading takes place when we have source classes available at compile time. 
We can make use of it by creating object instances with the new keyword.

Dynamic class loading refers to a situation when we can't provide a class definition at the compile time. 
Yet, we can do that at runtime. To create an instance of a class, we have to use the Class.forName() method:

Class.forName("oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver")
