Callback in C/C++ : The mechanism of calling a function from another function is called “callback”. 
Memory address of a function is represented as ‘function pointer’ in the languages like C and C++. 
So, the callback is achieved by passing the pointer of function1() to function2().

Callback in Java : But the concept of a callback function does not exist in Java because 
Java doesn’t have pointer concept. 
However, there are situations where one could speak of a callback object or a callback interface. 
Instead of passing the memory address of a function, interface is passed that refers to the location of a function.
