Since String is immutable in Java there is no way you can erase contents of String 
and since they are kept in String pool (in case of String literal) they stay longer on Java heap ,
which exposes risk of being seen by anyone who has access to Java memory, like reading from memory dump.

Instead char[] should be used to store password or sensitive information.
