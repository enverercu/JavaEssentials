Class loader enables the program to "load the class at run time". This is located in the java.lang package.

Using Class loader we can also load the customize classes which is required for the application execution. 
The class loaders in Java are organized in a tree. 

When JVM is started three class loaders are used:

Bootstrap class loader : The core java libraries. It is written in native code.

Extensions class loader : Loads the code in the extension directories.

System class loader : Code found on the java.class.path which map to the system class path variables. 
It is implemented by AppClassLoader class.

All user classes by default are load by the "system class loader".
